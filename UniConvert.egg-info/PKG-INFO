# Converters UniConvert Library

Welcome to the UniConvert Library documentation! The UniConvert Library is a Python tool designed for file conversion. It provides support for converting images to PNG format and videos to MP4 format. With this library, you can easily integrate file conversion capabilities into your projects.

## Main Features
- **Image Conversion**: Convert images to the PNG format effortlessly.
- **Video Conversion**: Convert videos to the MP4 format with ease.

## How to Use

1. Install the library: ``pip install uniconvert``
2. Import the relevant converters in your Python script.
3. Create instances of the converters and use their convert methods to perform conversions.


A seguir, apresentamos exemplos básicos de uso:

### Conversion of Images to PNG
```bash
from uniconvert.converter import PNGConverter

img_converter = PNGConverter()

img_path = "path/to/image.jpg"

converted_img_path = img_converter.convert(img_path)

print(f"Imagem convertida: {img_path} -> {converted_img_path}")
```
If you want that converted file replace the original then you can use ``replace=True`` in convert method.

### Converting Videos to MP4
```bash
from uniconvert.converters import MP4Converter

# Cria uma instância do conversor
video_converter = MP4Converter()

# Converte um vídeo para MP4
video_path = "caminho/do/video.avi"
converted_video_path = video_converter.convert(video_path, replace=True)

print(f"Vídeo convertido: {video_path} -> {converted_video_path}")
```

All the other conversion classes follow the same pattern as ``MP4Converter()``. You just need to specify the extension name, for example, ``AVIConverter()``, ``GPP3Converter()``, and so on.

The supported extensions for conversion include:

- AVI
- MOV
- 3GPP
- FLV
- WMV
- MPG
- WEBM
- MKV

# Roadmap
We are committed to expanding the functionalities of this library. Planned future enhancements include:

- Support for audio file conversion.
- Creation of specific classes for each file type.
